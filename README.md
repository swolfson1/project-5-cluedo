# Build a Cluedo Game

This week's was about Javascript, learning about arrays and objects. We looked at how to hook together html and css in this project!
The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
