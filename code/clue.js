// CREATE OBJECTS FOR ALL THE SUSPECTS, SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

  description: "He has a lot of connections",
  age: 45,

// THE ROOMS ONLY HAS A NAME SO NO NEED FOR OBJECTS THERE.

// NOW GROUP ALL SUSPECTS, WEAPONS AND ROOMS IN ARRAYS.

// CREATE AN OBJECT THAT KEEPS THE MYSTERY.
// With a killer, a weapon and a room.
// The values will be set later.

// FINISH THIS FUNCTION TO SHOW ALL INFORMATION ABOUT THE KILLER.
// This function will be invoked when you click on the killer card.
const pickKiller = () => {
  // This will randomly select a killer from the suspects. And add that to the mystery object.

  // This will change the background color of the card to the one connected to the chosen killer and show the full name of the killer.
  const theKiller = document.getElementById("killer")
  const theKillerName = document.getElementById("killerName")

  theKiller.style.background = mystery.killer.color
  theKillerName.innerHTML =
    mystery.killer.firstName + " " + mystery.killer.lastName
}

// CREATE FUNCTIONS pickWeapon and pickRoom in a similar way.

// CREATE A FUNCTION revealMystery that will be invoked when you click that button. It should show something like:
// 'The murder was committed by Jacob Green, in the living room with a rope.'
